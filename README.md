# Intro


## This is a REST server that can send WOL packets and also update your DDNS hostname. 

### One of the use-cases is ie. if your router flushes your computer's MAC instantly, so you can't send the WOL packet to your computer regularly, but instead you need to use some kind of a server on the local network which can do that for you.


# Usage


### You need to make a `.env` file. There you need to put the following variables:


```
TARGET_MAC=
SERVER_PORT=
WOL_PORT=
WEBHOOK_URL=
USE_NOIP=True
NOIP_CHECK_PERIOD=
NOIP_USERNAME=
NOIP_PASSWORD=
NOIP_HOSTNAME=
SERVER_LOGIN=
SERVER_PASSWORD=
```

### The variable names are pretty much self-explanatory. 


### Notice: If you don't want to use NOIP then change the USE_NOIP variable to anything other than "True" (it is case sensitive).


## Enjoy the script i guess!
